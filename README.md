# Hi there, I'm TheOmniOnic. Nice to meet you!

I'm a teenage self-taught programmer. I primarily use `Python` and `Rust`, but I dabble a bit in `TypeScript` too. I mostly focus on web development, but sometimes go off course into game development, coding silly projects like Dash (which relies on HTTP for getting files) too. I have experience with `Django`, and plan to use the `RYSR` (Rust Yew SurrealDB Rocket) stack one day too.
